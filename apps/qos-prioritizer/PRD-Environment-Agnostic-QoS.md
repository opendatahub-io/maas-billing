# Environment-Agnostic QoS System - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

This document defines the requirements for an **Environment-Agnostic Quality of Service (QoS) System** designed to provide intelligent request prioritization and resource management for Model-as-a-Service (MaaS) platforms across diverse deployment environments.

### Vision
Create a QoS system that delivers consistent business value regardless of underlying infrastructure, model characteristics, or performance capabilities.

### Key Objectives
- **Revenue Protection**: Ensure high-value customers receive priority treatment
- **Environment Transparency**: Work optimally across all hardware/model configurations
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Support multiple integration patterns (Envoy, Kubernetes, Kuadrant, Istio)
- **Production Readiness**: Handle enterprise-scale workloads with reliability guarantees

---

## Business Requirements

### Problem Statement
Current MaaS platforms treat all requests equally, leading to:
- **Revenue Risk**: Enterprise customers ($50k/year) wait behind free users ($0/year)
- **SLA Violations**: No service differentiation during high load periods
- **Poor ROI**: Expensive GPU resources allocated without business intelligence
- **Customer Churn**: Premium customers receive suboptimal experience

### Success Metrics
- **Enterprise SLA Compliance**: >99% of Enterprise requests meet response time SLAs
- **Revenue Protection**: Zero revenue loss due to customer tier confusion
- **Resource Efficiency**: >80% GPU utilization while maintaining service differentiation
- **System Reliability**: 99.9% uptime across all deployment environments

## Technical Requirements

### Environment Agnostic Design

#### Infrastructure Variance Support
The system MUST work transparently across:

| Variable | Range | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **GPU Performance** | V100 → H100 → Future GPUs | 10x-100x speed difference |
| **Model Size** | 7B → 405B parameters | 100x memory/compute difference |  
| **Response Time** | 100ms → 60s | 600x latency variance |
| **Concurrency** | 1 → 1000+ requests | 1000x capacity difference |
| **Infrastructure** | Single GPU → Multi-region clusters | Unlimited scale variance |

#### Algorithm Requirements
- **NO hardcoded timeouts** - must adapt to actual system performance
- **NO fixed capacity limits** - must discover backend capabilities dynamically
- **NO environment assumptions** - must work with any model/hardware combination
- **Relative prioritization only** - business logic independent of technical constraints

### Core Algorithm Specification

#### 1. Work-Conserving Priority Scheduler
```
PRIMARY RULE: Business priority always wins
- Enterprise > Premium > Free (absolute priority)
- Never waste available capacity
- Process lower priority when higher tiers empty

ANTI-STARVATION: Dynamic aging mechanism
- Boost priority based on relative wait time
- Wait thresholds adapt to system performance
- No absolute time limits
```

#### 2. Proportional Share Allocation
```
FAIR SHARE CALCULATION:
- Enterprise: 70% of available capacity
- Premium: 20% of available capacity  
- Free: 10% of available capacity

DYNAMIC CAPACITY DETECTION:
- Backend reports current capacity via health checks
- System adapts allocation based on real-time capabilities
- No assumptions about hardware limits
```

#### 3. Universal Circuit Breaker
```
PROTECTION LEVELS (per tier):
- Enterprise: 1% error rate threshold, 2x latency tolerance
- Premium: 5% error rate threshold, 5x latency tolerance
- Free: 20% error rate threshold, 10x latency tolerance

ADAPTIVE THRESHOLDS:
- Baseline latency calculated from historical performance
- Error rates based on tier-specific business requirements
- Automatic recovery when system health improves
```

```

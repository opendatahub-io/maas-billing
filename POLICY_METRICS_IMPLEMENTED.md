This repository implements the policy enforcement features we developed:

## Policy Metrics Enhancement

### Features Implemented:
- **Policy Type Display**: Shows AuthPolicy/RateLimitPolicy decisions with color-coded chips
- **Rejection Reasons**: Displays specific reasons for policy decisions (e.g., 'Invalid API key', 'Rate limit exceeded')
- **Deduplication Fix**: Prevents growing duplicate entries in live metrics
- **Policy Filtering**: Filter metrics by policy type (AuthPolicy, RateLimitPolicy, None)
- **Real-time Ready**: Prepared for actual Kuadrant traffic data

### Key Changes Made:
1. **Frontend Interface Updates**:
   - Added `policyType` and `reason` fields to Request interface
   - Enhanced MetricsDashboard component with policy column and filtering
   - Implemented deduplication logic in useLiveRequests hook

2. **Backend Improvements**:
   - Updated MetricsService with policy classification
   - Added static policy enforcement examples
   - Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces

### Technical Details:
- **Policy Chips**: Color-coded (red for AuthPolicy, teal for RateLimitPolicy)
- **Static IDs**: Prevents continuous data growth issue
- **Enhanced Search**: Includes policy reasons in search functionality

The live metrics page now shows stable data with policy enforcement details, ready for integration with real Kuadrant traffic when available.
